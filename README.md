# hello-world
This is like a tutorial of some sorts. 

Hello there. My name is Aniesa. 

I'm a starter coder and I can't wait to dive into this. I'm 17 years old and currently live in Northwest Indiana. I graduate in June. Class of 2021! I love reading and baking. I'm a makeup enthusiast and love shopping.

Hopefully I can navigate this really well and don't lose interest in this. Let's see where this takes me.
